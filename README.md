# ResNeXt: Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks

- 0. PyTorch implementation of [Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431)
- 1. This is only a model builder implementation by pytorch.
- 2. The model is tested on Cifar10
- 3. Thanks to the original [implementation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ResNeXt) by the author and the official ResNet [implementation](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/models/resnet.py)
